✅ Summary:

⭐:Project:
Create a complete visualization mastery project, starting from basic Seaborn/Matplotlib plots, moving to Plotly interactive & animated visualizations, then 3D plots, marginal plots, advanced subplots, and finally geospatial maps.

⭐:Key Ideas & Suggestions:
Project Structure: Modularize by library and type of plot for maintainability.
Datasets: Start with Diamonds dataset (Seaborn), extend to Titanic, finance, and geospatial datasets.
Customization: Include annotations, palettes, legends, subplots, axes scaling, gridlines, fonts, and saving options.
Interactivity: Use Plotly for hover info, facet plots, and animation.
Advanced Plots: Include 3D scatter/line, treemaps, sunburst, waterfall, candlestick, ternary charts.
Reproducibility: Store final plots, export as images or HTML for presentations or dashboards.
Version Control: GitHub repository with .gitignore, LICENSE, and detailed README.

⭐:Future Thoughts:
Integrate with Dash / Streamlit for interactive dashboards.
Add CI/CD with GitHub Actions to automatically render & save plots when code updates.
Expand to real-world datasets (finance, e-commerce, weather, COVID-19).
Build a visualization portfolio to showcase mastery for job interviews.
